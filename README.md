FreeOSEK_LPC1769
================

FreeOSEK OS implementation for LPC1769 microcontrollers.

This is a LPCXpresso workspace, but you need to have PHP installed in order to run the generation steps.
If you're using Ubuntu you can install PHP by typing:

$ sudo apt-get install php5

If you're using Windows, you can download PHP from http://windows.php.net/
Unzip the file and add the destination path to your PATH environment variable.
You can check if PHP is correctly installed by opening a command line and type:

> php -v

You should see something like this:

PHP 5.5.15 (cli) (built: Jul 23 2014 15:05:09)
Copyright (c) 1997-2014 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.5.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2014 Zend Technologies

As you can see, this repository has been tested with package php-5.5.15-Win32-VC11-x86.
